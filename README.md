Trading operations analysis



This project consists of modifying a spreadsheet containing stock trading data to better analyse performance. Four tabs are created:

1. My trades: Table with trading data, formatted and with dates in a specific format.
2. Stock exchanges: Pivot table that groups markets by state and calculates the number of shares traded and tax liability.
3. Profit insights: Calculation of holding time and profit per trade, with a bar chart and commentary.
4. Number of trades exchanged: Contingency table that calculates the relative probabilities of trades by region and quantity.

Each tab follows specific formatting and structuring rules.
